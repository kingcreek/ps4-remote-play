PS4 Remote Play client (WIP)
============================

*Note: this project is NOT affiliated with, funded, or in any way associated
with Sony Interactive Entertainment.*

**Goal**: having an open source implementation of the PS4 Remote Play protocol
as well as a client which works on Linux. Both local and remote remote play
should be supported.

**Current status**:

 - Supports the initial registration protocol.
 - Supports local "wake on LAN".

**TODO**:

 - Draw the rest of the f-ing owl :)
 - Local streaming protocol RE and implementation (video, audio, input).
 - Remote streaming protocol RE and implementation (video, audio, input).
 - PSN / OAuth based pairing and remote wakeup.
